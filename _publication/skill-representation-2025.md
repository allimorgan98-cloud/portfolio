abstract: 
  "Understanding and modeling human skill is critical
for advancing human-robot and human-AI interaction, particularly
in domains requiring nuanced cooperation and long-term
personalization. Effective collaboration depends on aligning AI
behavior with human capabilities, but quantifying skill is challenging,
requiring both task knowledge and expert intuition. This
work proposes a data-driven approach to modeling human skill
through repeated interactions. Using high-performance driving
education (HPDE) as a case study, we synthesize literature and
expert insights to identify supervision signals for learning a robust
skill representation. Leveraging a dataset of novice and expert
drivers, we demonstrate the feasibility of automatically extracting
skill representations from track-driving trajectory data. This
foundation enables applications such as personalized coaching,
skill-targeted challenges, and adaptive robotic interventions.
Ultimately, we aim to democratize HPDE by making high-quality
instruction more accessible through AI-driven personalization."
