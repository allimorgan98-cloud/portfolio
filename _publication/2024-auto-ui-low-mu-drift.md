abstract: >-
  Drifting, a skillful driving technique involving intentional traction loss and counter-steering, traditionally demands
  high-speed maneuvers under high-friction conditions, posing significant risks and fear for novices. Our study explores
  low-µ (low friction) emulation, simulating icy conditions to facilitate drift training at safer, lower speeds...
