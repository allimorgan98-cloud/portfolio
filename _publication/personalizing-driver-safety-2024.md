abstract: >- "Recent advances in AI and intelligent vehicle technology hold the promise of revolutionizing mobility
and transportation through advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Certain cognitive factors,
such as impulsivity and inhibitory control have been shown to relate to risky driving behavior and
on-road risk-taking. However, existing systems fail to leverage such factors in assistive driving
technologies adequately. Varying the levels of these cognitive factors could influence the effectiveness
and acceptance of ADAS interfaces. We demonstrate an approach for personalizing driver interaction
via driver safety interfaces that are are triggered based on the inference of the driverâ€™s latent cognitive
states from their driving behavior.

To accomplish this, we adopt a data-driven approach and train
a recurrent neural network to infer impulsivity and inhibitory control from recent driving behavior.
The network is trained on a population of human drivers to infer impulsivity and inhibitory control
from recent driving behavior. Using data collected from a high-fidelity vehicle motion simulator
experiment, we demonstrate the ability to deduce these factors from driver behavior.

We then use these inferred factors to determine instantly whether or not to engage a driver safety interface.
This approach was evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation using actual human data. Our
evaluations reveal that our personalized driver safety interface that captures the cognitive profile
of the driver is more effective in influencing driver behavior in yellow light zones by reducing their
inclination to run through them."
