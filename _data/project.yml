      <p>The course registration process at Seoul National University, often referred to as a "war," is notoriously competitive due to its first-come, first-served nature.<br></p>

      <p>During this process, students occasionally refresh the registration website by mistake. When this happens, the system immediately displays an error message and forces the user to log in again. While this might be a measure to prevent the use of macros (though this remains unconfirmed), it poses a significant problem, since logging in again during such a high-pressure moment wastes precious time.<br></p>

      <p>To address this issue, I developed a browser extension that allows users to bypass the error message with a single click, eliminating the need for a full log-in. This extension is compatible with both <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snu-crs-refresher/hhdokgcmhmpckjdhekdjpoaafoggaaan'>Chrome</a> and <a href='https://store.whale.naver.com/detail/dkhijlinmdhldgjbbpmmelahpbnhmpcc'>Whale</a> browsers.</p>

      <p>Have you ever wished a robot to send romantic messages to the other on
      behalf of yourself? Having a conversation in a romantic relationship is
      often difficult. Sometimes we ask our friends for help, but such help is
      limited.<br></p>

      <p>In this project, we assumed that an AI agent in chat settings became so
      smart that it perfectly analyzes the counterpart's emotion and suggests
      responses in a chat setting. Along with a prototype app LOVEGORITHM that
      helps such a romantic relationship, we designed and developed an LOVEGORITHM
      online user community that illustrates possible feedback and behaviors of
      users. Check out the link above!<br></p>

      <p>Due to the irreversible characteristics and disastrous effects of
      Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), a precise diagnosis of the symptoms
      is extremely important. Yet, paper-based Amsler Grid, the most prevalent
      testing method, is highly limited in that it requires the indirect report of
      patients and quantitative reporting is difficult.<br></p>

      <p>In this project, I designed and developed a touch-based Amsler grid web
      app. As such, I aimed to support patients' exact report of their regions of
      symptoms.<br></p>

      <p>What made this project special to me is that, I made a LaTeX template for
      writing this paper! I found that my friends preparing for their thesis
      always felt it difficult to produce a thesis format, since our department
      only gave us a 'scanned' version of template, not a real document. Thus, I
      generated a template which can be found <a
      href='https://github.com/donghoon-io/SNUECE-BS-thesis'>here</a> (this
      template was built upon previous Ph.D. dissertation template under
      license)<br></p>

      <p>This study was conducted for my B.S. thesis, and later published in HCI
      Korea 2022.</p>

      <p>Prolonged time of computer use increased the prevalence of ocular
      problems including eyestrain, tired eyes, irritation, redness, blurred
      vision, and double vision, collectively referred to as computer vision
      syndrome. We aimed to explore the interface elements of
      computer-based intervention for computer vision syndrome to set design
      guidelines based on pros/cons of each interface element.<br></p>

      <p>In this project, I developed LiquidEye, an intervention application
      targeted to MacOS. To understand which design elements of
      intervention app do users prefer, we collected each user's
      time-series system preferences through the study, which were jointly analyzed with the
      self-reported satisfaction to identify the significance of each
      element statistically. (JMIR '21 paper)</p>

      ML-infused chatbot that moderates conversation between strangers with
      personalized topics. Based on social media posts, BlahBlahBot supports the
      conversation by suggesting topics that are likely to be of mutual interest
      between users.<br></p>

      <p>A user study with three groups (control, random topic chatbot, and
      BlahBlahBot; N=18) found the feasibility of BlahBlahBot in increasing both
      conversation quality and closeness to the partner, along with the factors
      that led to such increases from the user interview. Overall, our preliminary
      results imply that an ML-infused conversational agent can be effective for
      augmenting a dyadic conversation. (CHI '21 Late-Breaking Work)</p>

      <p>According to a recent survey conducted by American Psychological
      Association [1], academic stress is cited as the number one stressor in
      students' daily life. This issue is specifically considered serious in South
      Korea, where half of Korean teenagers experienced a thought of suicidal and
      academic stress is reported as a top-ranked attribute to such phenomenon
      [2].<br></p>

      <p>This, however, cannot be solely dealt with reducing academic affair.
      Since such academic phenomenon is multi-faceted with lots of stakeholders
      involved (e.g., homeroom teacher, parents, and friends), we should not
      naïvely understand the issue. For example, high schools often focus on
      increasing the number of students entering so-called 'prestigious
      universities.' However, by solely focusing on the name of university rather
      than a major, this often undermines the agency of students' decision on
      their future career, and leading students to suffer from subsidious academic
      stresses as well as a stress on the study itself.<br></p>

      <p>Since the academic curriculum drastically changes over time and
      policy-makers and relatively older people cannot easily understand such a
      situation, we aimed to show how difficult it is for high school students to
      'survive' under such factors that often lead to academic stresses. By having
      users choose a choice in each crossroad of choices and differentiating the
      following storieline, we, though indirectly, let them feel how stressed high
      school students would be in the midst of a choice.<br></p>

      <p>In this project, we designed an application to support students who had been studying abroad but returned home due to the pandemic. Many of them struggled with irregular sleep patterns caused by time zone differences, which affected both their health and academic performance. To deeply understand their needs, we conducted a series of research activities, including in-depth interviews, observational studies of YouTube vloggers, diary studies, and web-based surveys.<br></p>
      
      <p>Based on our findings, we developed <em>夜-planet</em>, an application tailored to students navigating these challenges. The character '夜' means 'night' in Chinese, and the name reflects the app’s focus on supporting nocturnal lifestyles.<br></p>

      <p>At the end of my sophomore year, I came across a CHI paper by chance: <em>“Blocks4All: Overcoming Accessibility Barriers to Blocks Programming for Children with Visual Impairments”</em> by Milne and colleagues. The paper explored how to make block-based programming tools more accessible for children with visual impairments. I was fascinated by how HCI researchers deeply engaged with specific user groups and translated design implications into tangible systems.<br></p> <p>Around that same time, my supervisor asked if I’d be interested in leading a project to develop an AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) application. I immediately said yes; at that point, I was eager to get involved in research, but opportunities were scarce for undergraduates without prior experience. From then on, I spent countless nights developing an iOS app, conducting user studies, reading papers, and designing interfaces. Everything was new to me—from receiving research funding to navigating the IRB process for our study. As luck would have it, we wrapped up the project just in time for the CHI 2020 deadline. We submitted our work, and it was accepted with an Honorable Mention Award.<br></p> <p>In our paper, we emphasized that AAC stakeholders shouldn’t be limited to just the child, but must include caregivers as essential partners in communication. With that in mind, we developed <em>Talkingboogie</em>, a mobile AAC system designed to support children with developmental disabilities and their caregivers in collaboratively shaping effective communication strategies.</p>

      <p>I believe that one's favourite set of music in a specific period
      represents own emotion at that period. To prove this, I listed all my
      favourite songs by each semester. Then, I analyzed the emotion of each song
      using <a href='https://cyanite.ai'>Cyanite</a>, and I visualized the results
      with <a href='https://d3js.org'>D3.js</a>.<br></p>

      <p>Well, I was super shocked by the result. For my depressing time, I used
      to listen to melancholic songs. For my highest period, my playlist was full
      of happy and energetic songs. Why don't you try with your own
      playlist?<br></p>

      <p>I worked as an iOS developer at a local micro-mobility sharing startup for two years. During this time, I realized how crucial it is to understand potential users for a service to succeed.</p>
      
      <p>To deepen this understanding, I took a 'Digital Ethnography' class, where students explored user groups around a chosen topic. I focused on why users hesitate to ride shared mobility devices and investigated this through ethnographic methods.</p>
      
      <p>I conducted observational and interview studies with six college students. Although the scope was limited due to the pandemic, the experience gave me valuable insight into how HCI researchers apply qualitative methods to study real-world user behavior.</p>

      <p>Although text-based conversational agents (chatbots) hold great potential for journaling diets and managing personal health, they suffer from low user acceptance. To address this issue, we propose incorporating the persona of real-world caregivers into the chatbot.<br></p>

      <p>Working with <a href='https://youjin-h.github.io'>Youjin Hwang</a>, we
      conducted a series of studies identifying several important linguistic features that make users

      <p>I found it incredibly difficult to keep track of the courses I took in college, and I was surprised to learn that many others faced the same problem.<br></p>

      <p>To simplify the process, I developed an iOS app called ECE Grad. This app helps ECE undergrads easily track the courses they've completed and see how many credits they still need. It also automatically visualizes their course history and provides encouraging messages to motivate them to stay on top of their academic progress.<br></p>

      <p>However, some users mentioned that manually entering courses into the system was a bit time-consuming. Based on their feedback, I added a crawling function to streamline the process: by simply entering their SNU credentials, the system automatically retrieves the relevant course data.</p>
