            <p>Research is a team sport, and I've been lucky to have an all-star team of friends and collaborators inspiring me along the way (some are now senior enough that "friend" feels too casual, but you get the idea).</p>
            <p>From SNU to UW, my work has been always built on their support, and I wanted to give a few special shout-outs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://jaewook-lee.com/">Jaewook Lee (UW)</a>: My go-to for emotional support, invaluable career + technical HCI advice, and, most importantly, a top-tier drinking buddy. Thanks for keeping me sane through it all.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://youjin-h.github.io/">Youjin Hwang (Samsung)</a>: My OG research partner 1 and part of the SNU dream team! She paved the way for my work in healthcare and taught me how to run a full-cycle research project from start to finish. Her creativity and perspective were invaluable, and I cherish the time we spent working together.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://k-soomin.github.io/">Soomin Kim (Samsung)</a>: My OG research partner 2 and a pioneer in chatbot research (imagine you're hard-coding LLM responses.. and we did it back then). I learned basically everything I know about running chatbot studies from her. Our projects were some of the most fun I've ever had, and we had an undefeated record... our work never got rejected! (fact-check pls)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://bguoac.info/">Gloria Guo (UW)</a>: An amazing collaborator whose constant encouragement and camaraderie made the tough days at UW not just bearable, but genuinely fun. You'll be amazed at her incredible system-building skills. (prospective PhD advisors: hire her!)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieljslee/">Daniel Lee (Adobe)</a>: He reached out to me during my first week at my Adobe Research internship (at first I was like.. why me?) and has been a huge inspiration for my work in LLM interaction ever since. Our collaboration on PosterMate and ThematicPlane for UIST was an absolute blast.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucascolusso/">Lucas Colusso (Microsoft)</a>: He's like a semi-academic dad to me, paving the way for my research into translational science for designers using generative AI. My Paper2Card project was basically a sequel to his foundational work.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://www.byalexchen.com/">Alex Chen (UW)</a>: A fantastic collaborator who is a wizard at both design and code. Working with him was effortless and made our project so much better.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://atgao.github.io/">Alice Gao (UW)</a>: Her computer vision background is like a secret weapon! They make tackling tricky UI problems way easier, and I could easily get to build cooler, more useful systems for building translational artifacts.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><a href="http://www.changhoonoh.com/">Changhoon Oh (Yonsei)</a>: A brilliant and dependable collaborator from my early days. His pioneering work in human-AI interaction was a major inspiration for my own research on HAI systems.</p>

            <p class="subsection-title">Why monochrome?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-md-8 mb-md-0 mb-3 align-self-center">
            <p>Some of you may have noticed that my entire website, and most of my design work, is in grayscale. This isn't just a coincidence; even my wardrobe is surprisingly monochrome. It's intentional.</p>
            <p>That's because, one lesson I learned early on as an amateur designer is -- unless you're a genius with color, it's often better not to use it at all. Then my question gets:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Am I skilled enough to impress my audience solely with color? Probably not.</li>
                <li><p>Am I skilled enough to ensure my design won't introduce any additional redundancies? Probably yes.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This is likely true for most people, and it can even reduce the time spent considering too many design factors -- especially for those with agile workflows, like system HCI researchers like myself. If that's the case, trust me -- simply keeping your design monochrome, ideally in black and white, can significantly improve its mood.</p>
            <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center my-4">
            <img src="{{ '/assets/images/misc/color_comparison.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="responsive-width mb-2">
            <p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;">Grayscale designs often achieve the same or better level of visual appeal as well-colored ones, with significantly less time and effort.</p>
            </div>
            <p>But what if you have to use color -- say, your branding requires it? In those cases, I usually limit the value (in HSV terms) to below 30%. In other words, I keep the colors as dark as possible. That way, I can stay true to the branding without sacrificing the sleek, minimal style.</p>
            <p>Still, I would try my best to stick with a fully grayscaled style; technically, that means setting saturation to 0% in HSV. This way, the focus stays on the content itself, not on potentially questionable color choices.</p>
